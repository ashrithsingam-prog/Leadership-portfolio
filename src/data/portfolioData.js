      narrative: "Rajan had his strongest month since joining — composite score jumped from 64 to 71, driven by a breakthrough in Facility 3 batch validation. He closed 16 of 20 assigned deliverables, including the process validation protocol for the lyophilized injectable line that had been stuck in regulatory review since December. Framework application remains his gap area (52, below the 60 threshold), but his delivery and IP scores now exceed V3 requirements. He's tracking ahead of plan for V3 eligibility."

      narrative: "Rajan shipped 16 of 20 deliverables — his highest completion rate since the Facility 3 program launched. The process validation protocol was the critical win: it had been cycling between regulatory affairs and QA since December, and Rajan broke the logjam by organizing a joint review session with both teams instead of sequential sign-offs. He created 7 original work items this month, including the deviation investigation SOP that the Head of Quality has now mandated as the standard across all three manufacturing facilities."

      narrative: "Delivery (80) and engagement (85) are Rajan's strongest areas — he ships consistently and participates in every organizational ritual. Original work (74) has been climbing steadily since he started creating reusable SOPs and templates that other teams adopt. The gap is in framework application (52, below the 60 threshold) and process adoption (58). Rajan tends to solve production problems through direct technical troubleshooting rather than applying structured diagnostic frameworks — effective for immediate fixes, but it means root causes sometimes recur. This is the main growth area for V3 readiness."

Deviation closure rate (78% vs 90%) was the biggest miss: 4 deviations from January are still open pending root cause confirmation from the contract testing lab."

      narrative: "8 constraints raised, 5 resolved. Two patterns dominate: external dependencies (contract lab turnaround, vendor lead times) and approval bottlenecks (regulatory review cycles). The HEPA filter delay was the costliest — 2 failed batches and 11 days of investigation before the root cause was confirmed, all because replacement filters had a 6-week lead time and no safety stock. Rajan resolved the regulatory review bottleneck by switching from sequential to joint review sessions — a process improvement that now saves 3 weeks per protocol. The second shift supervisor vacancy is the most persistent constraint: single-shift operation since February is capping production throughput at 60% of Facility 3 capacity."

His delivery and IP scores already exceed V3 thresholds, which is unusual for someone 5 months into V2. The gap is capability: framework application (52) and process adoption (58) both below the 60 minimum. If he consciously applies and documents structured frameworks in his daily work over the next 3-4 months — rather than defaulting to ad-hoc technical problem-solving — he'll be eligible well ahead of schedule."
